Coolify is an all-in one PaaS that helps you to self-host your own applications, databases or services (like Wordpress, Plausible Analytics, Ghost) without managing your servers, also known as an **open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative**.

## Features



    Coolify is compatible with a wide range of programming languages and
    frameworks, enabling you to launch static websites, APIs, backends,
    databases, services, and other types of applications.
  

    You can deploy your resources to any server, including your own servers,
    VPS, Raspberry Pi, EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner
    (<a class="underline" href="https://coolify.io/hetzner" target="_blank">referral link</a>),
    and more. All you need is an SSH connection.
  

    You can deploy your resources to a single server, multiple servers, or
    Docker Swarm clusters according to your requirements.

    (Support for Kubernetes is on the way!)
  
  
    Nowadays, Git integration is considered the norm. We provide integration
    with both hosted and self-hosted platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket,
    Gitea, and others.
  

    Coolify takes care of automatically setting up and renewing Let's Encrypt
    SSL certificates for your custom domains, so you can relax and not have to
    deal with it.
  

    Your data is automatically backed up to any S3 compatible solution, allowing
    you to easily restore it with just a few clicks if any problems occur.
  
 
    Integrate into your CI/CD pipelines or create custom integrations using
    GitHub Actions, Gitlab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, or any other CI/CD tool of
    your choice.
  
 
    Coolify offers a robust API that enables you to automate deployments, manage
    resources, and integrate with your current tools, providing limitless
    possibilities.
  
  
    Share your projects with your team members and work together on them. You
    can also control permissions and roles for each member.
  

    Automagically deploy new commits and pull requests separately to quickly
    review contributions and speed up your teamwork!
  
 
    Once your server is connected, Coolify will handle numerous tasks
    automatically, allowing you to concentrate on your code.
  

    Coolify will keep an eye on your deployments, servers, disk usage, and other
    aspects, and notify you if any issues arise.
  
  
    Coolify will notify you through your chosen channels like Discord, Telegram,
    and email in case of any events on your server or with your deployments.
