## Introduction

##



Add a Wordpress service with the one-click installation feature in Coolify.


Change the following lines in your `docker-compose.yml` file from the UI to persist the Wordpress files on the host machine:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "wordpress-files:/var/www/html"
```

to:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "./wordpress:/var/www/html"
```

This will mount the `wordpress` directory in the default configuration directory (`/data/coolify/services/<serviceUuid>/`) to the `/var/www/html` directory in the container.

This way, you can edit the files on your host machine and see the changes reflected in the container.



Start the Wordpress service and configure it as you wish.


1. Go to your Wordpress admin panel.
2. Go to `Plugins` -> `Installed Plugins`.
3. Select all plugins and choose `Deactivate` from the dropdown menu.


1. Open your `wp-config.php` file on the server and add the following lines:

```php
define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );
```

Refresh your WordPress panel in your browser. You should now see a new menu item called `Network Setup` under the `Tools` menu.
