# TLDR

1. Create a bucket in AWS Console
2. Create a custom policy in AWS Console with the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        // rewrite your-bucket-name with your bucket name
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Create an IAM user in AWS Console & attach the policy from the previous step.
4. Go to User settings & create an `Access Key` in AWS Console.
5. Add the `Access Key` and `Secret Key` in Coolify when you create a new S3 source.
   
     You need to use the S3 HTTP endpoit without the bucket name, for example,
     `https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`.
   

# Detailed steps

### Create a bucket



    Go to [AWS Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets) and
    create a new bucket. 
  
 


### Create a new policy



    Go to [AWS Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and create a new policy.

  

   Add the following JSON permissions to your policy (replace `your-bucket-name` with your bucket name):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

  


### Create a new IAM user


 
    Go to [AWS Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and
    create a new user. 

  
 

  

 
    You will need it to configure this S3 storage in Coolify.

  


### Configure S3 in Coolify



    Go to your Coolify instance and create a new S3 storage.


    Make sure you use the S3 HTTP endpoint without the bucket name. For example,
    `https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`. 
  


Well done!
